# S309: The Broadly Neutralizing Antibody

**Type:** Human [monoclonal antibody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibody) (IgG1)  
**Target:** [SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/43740568)  
**PDB:** [7R6X](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7R6X)  
**Developers:** [Vir Biotechnology](https://www.vir.bio/) & [GlaxoSmithKline](https://www.gsk.com/)  
**Derived drug:** [Sotrovimab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sotrovimab) (VIR-7831)  

## The 17-Year Connection

In 2003, a SARS-CoV-1 survivor in Singapore donated blood samples. Those samples sat in freezers for over a decade. Then, in 2020, researchers discovered something remarkable: antibodies from that 2003 patient could neutralize the brand-new SARS-CoV-2.

**17 years of viral evolution, and the antibody still worked.**

This is the power of targeting conserved epitopes—and it made S309 one of the most durable COVID therapeutics.

## The Origin Story

### Vir Biotechnology's Gamble

[Vir Biotechnology](https://www.vir.bio/), founded by [George Scangos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Scangos) in 2016, had a strategy: collect antibodies from survivors of serious infections and bank them for future pandemics.

When COVID-19 emerged, Vir had a head start. They'd already isolated hundreds of antibodies from SARS-CoV-1 survivors, including S309.

### Cross-Neutralization Discovery

[Davide Corti](https://www.vir.bio/leadership/) and colleagues tested their SARS-CoV-1 antibody collection against the new virus. [The results](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2349-y), published in Nature in May 2020, showed S309 potently neutralized both viruses.

## The Conserved Epitope Strategy

### Why S309 Lasted Longer

Most early COVID antibodies (like [bamlanivimab](./bamlanivimab)) targeted the [Receptor Binding Motif (RBM)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7526584/)—the exact surface that binds ACE2. This site is under intense selective pressure; mutations help the virus spread faster.

S309 targets a different site that:

- Is conserved across [sarbecoviruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbecovirus) (SARS-like coronaviruses)
- Does NOT overlap with the ACE2-binding surface
- Contains an [N-glycan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-linked_glycosylation) (N343) that the virus needs for proper folding

Mutations here tend to **cripple the virus**—so they rarely spread.

### The Glycan Contact

Most antibodies avoid [glycans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycan) (sugar chains on proteins). They're flexible and hard to bind. But S309 embraces the N343 glycan as part of its epitope.

This is unusual and important: the glycan is functionally constrained, making it hard for the virus to mutate away.

## Clinical Success

[Sotrovimab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sotrovimab) (the drug derived from S309) showed remarkable durability:

| Variant | Most antibodies | Sotrovimab |
|---------|-----------------|------------|
| Alpha | ✓ | ✓ |
| Beta | ✗ (E484K escape) | ✓ |
| Gamma | ✗ | ✓ |
| Delta | Variable | ✓ |
| Omicron BA.1 | ✗ | Reduced but active |
| Omicron BA.2+ | ✗ | Eventually escaped |

Sotrovimab lasted about 6 months longer than other antibodies before variant escape.

## Design Lessons

S309 teaches critical principles for durable binder design:

1. **Conserved epitopes persist** — Target sites under functional constraint
2. **Don't follow the crowd** — The obvious binding site (RBM) mutated fastest
3. **Glycan contacts can help** — Not all epitopes are protein-only
4. **Cross-reactivity indicates conservation** — If it binds related viruses, the epitope is likely conserved
5. **17 years is possible** — Evolution doesn't eliminate all epitopes
