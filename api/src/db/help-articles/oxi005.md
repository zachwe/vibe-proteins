# OXI-005 Analytical Antibody

**Type:** Mouse monoclonal antibody  
**Target:** Insulin  
**PDB:** [2OSL](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2OSL)  
**Use:** Research and diagnostics  
**Developer:** Various research laboratories  

## What is it?

OXI-005 is a high-precision analytical antibody used primarily in research and diagnostic applications for insulin detection. Unlike therapeutic antibodies designed to treat disease, OXI-005 represents the class of antibodies developed for measurement and analysis purposes.

## Research vs. therapeutic antibodies

Antibodies serve different purposes in biomedicine:

| Type | Purpose | Key properties |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Therapeutic | Treat disease | Safety, efficacy, low immunogenicity |
| Diagnostic | Detect molecules | Specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility |
| Research | Study biology | Availability, cost, versatility |

OXI-005 falls into the latter categories—optimized for detecting insulin with high precision rather than blocking its function.

## Applications in insulin research

Analytical antibodies like OXI-005 enable:

- **ELISA assays** - Quantifying insulin levels in blood samples
- **Western blots** - Detecting insulin in tissue extracts
- **Immunohistochemistry** - Visualizing insulin in pancreatic tissue
- **Quality control** - Ensuring purity in insulin manufacturing

## Binding characteristics

The [crystal structure](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2OSL) shows how OXI-005 recognizes insulin:

- Binds to a specific epitope on the insulin molecule
- High specificity distinguishes insulin from proinsulin and other variants
- Suitable for quantitative measurements due to consistent binding

## Design lessons for protein engineers

1. **Different goals, different designs** - Analytical antibodies prioritize specificity and reproducibility over therapeutic properties

2. **Structural biology informs detection** - Understanding antibody-antigen complexes helps design better assays

3. **Mouse antibodies in research** - Unlike therapeutics (which need humanization), research antibodies can remain as mouse proteins

4. **Validation matters** - Analytical antibodies must be extensively validated for their intended application
