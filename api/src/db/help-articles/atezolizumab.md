## Unmasking Cancer

Atezolizumab ([Tecentriq](https://www.tecentriq.com/)) was the first [PD-L1 inhibitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkpoint_inhibitor) approved by the FDA. It represents a revolution in cancer treatment: instead of attacking tumors directly, it helps the immune system find and destroy cancer.

## The Checkpoint Revolution

### How Cancer Hides

Your immune system's [T cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell) are constantly patrolling for abnormal cells. When they find cancer, they should attack. But tumors have evolved a defense: they display [PD-L1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PD-L1) on their surface.

PD-L1 binds to [PD-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death_protein_1) on T cells, delivering a "don't attack me" signal. It's normally a safety mechanism to prevent autoimmunity—but cancer hijacks it.

### Checkpoint Inhibitors

[James Allison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_P._Allison) and [Tasuku Honjo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasuku_Honjo) won the [2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2018/summary/) for discovering this checkpoint pathway. Their work enabled drugs like atezolizumab.

By blocking PD-L1, atezolizumab removes cancer's invisibility cloak, allowing T cells to recognize and destroy tumor cells.

## The Genentech Story

### From Discovery to Drug

[Genentech](https://www.gene.com/), the legendary South San Francisco biotech (now part of [Roche](https://www.roche.com/)), developed atezolizumab from their antibody platform.

The program benefited from Genentech's decades of antibody engineering experience—the same expertise that produced [Herceptin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trastuzumab) and [Avastin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab).

### The Clinical Trials

Atezolizumab's approval was based on dramatic responses in [bladder cancer](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bladder-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20356104):

- Some patients with advanced cancer achieved **complete remissions**
- Responses were often **durable**—lasting years
- Side effects were different from chemotherapy—primarily autoimmune

## Binding Mechanism

[The crystal structure](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5X8L) reveals how atezolizumab blocks PD-L1:

1. **Heavy chain dominates** — VH contributes most binding contacts
2. **Epitope overlaps PD-1 site** — Direct competition for the same interface
3. **Large buried surface** — ~2,000 Å² for high affinity
4. **Multiple aromatic contacts** — Tyrosines and tryptophans at the interface

The antibody essentially mimics PD-1's binding mode, but with much higher affinity.

## Clinical Impact

Atezolizumab is now approved for:

- [Non-small cell lung cancer](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lung-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20374620) (NSCLC)
- [Small cell lung cancer](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/small-cell-lung-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352558) (SCLC)
- [Triple-negative breast cancer](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470) (TNBC)
- [Hepatocellular carcinoma](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/liver-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353659) (HCC)
- [Melanoma](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884)
- [Bladder cancer](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bladder-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20356104)

## Design Lessons

1. **Blocking PPIs works** — Even "flat" [protein-protein interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein%E2%80%93protein_interaction) can be drugged
2. **Epitope overlap is key** — Must compete with the natural ligand
3. **Immune modulation is powerful** — Redirecting existing biology can beat cancer
4. **Humanized antibodies have low immunogenicity** — Framework matters
