# Panitumumab (Vectibix)

**Type:** Fully human [monoclonal antibody](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/monoclonal-antibody) (IgG2)  
**Target:** EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor)  
**PDB:** [5SX4](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5SX4)  
**FDA Approved:** 2006  
**Developer:** [Amgen](https://www.amgen.com/)  

## What is it?

Panitumumab (brand name Vectibix) is the first fully human monoclonal antibody targeting EGFR. Developed using Amgen's XenoMouse technology, it represents an advancement over chimeric antibodies like [cetuximab](/help/cetuximab) in terms of reduced immunogenicity.

## Fully human advantage

Panitumumab was created using **XenoMouse**—mice engineered with human immunoglobulin genes:

| Generation | Example | Human content | Immunogenicity |
|------------|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Mouse | Research abs | 0% | High |
| Chimeric | Cetuximab | ~65% | Moderate |
| Humanized | Trastuzumab | ~95% | Low |
| Fully human | Panitumumab | 100% | Lowest |

Being fully human, panitumumab triggers fewer infusion reactions and anti-drug antibody responses than cetuximab.

## IgG2 isotype choice

Uniquely among EGFR antibodies, panitumumab uses the **IgG2 isotype**:

| Property | IgG1 (cetuximab) | IgG2 (panitumumab) |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| ADCC | Strong | Weak |
| CDC | Moderate | Weak |
| Primary mechanism | Blocking + killing | Blocking only |

This design choice was intentional—by eliminating effector functions, panitumumab works purely through EGFR blockade. Clinical trials showed comparable efficacy, suggesting that for EGFR inhibition, blocking the receptor is sufficient.

## Binding mechanism

Panitumumab binds to EGFR domain III, similar to cetuximab:

- Competes with EGF for binding
- Prevents receptor dimerization
- Induces receptor internalization
- Higher binding affinity than cetuximab

## KRAS: same story, same lesson

Like cetuximab, panitumumab only works in **KRAS wild-type** tumors:

- The PRIME study confirmed KRAS-mutant patients don't benefit
- Extended RAS testing (KRAS + NRAS) further refines patient selection
- About 50% of colorectal cancer patients are RAS wild-type

This shared requirement reinforced that the pathway biology—not the antibody format—determines who responds.

## Clinical applications

Panitumumab is approved for:

- **Metastatic colorectal cancer** - First-line and later-line therapy in RAS wild-type tumors
- Typically combined with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI chemotherapy

## Every-2-weeks dosing

Panitumumab's longer half-life enables **every-2-week dosing** versus weekly for cetuximab. This improves convenience without sacrificing efficacy.

## Design lessons for protein engineers

1. **Fully human reduces immunogenicity** - XenoMouse and similar platforms produce antibodies with minimal foreign sequences

2. **Isotype affects function** - IgG2's weak effector functions can be a feature, not a bug

3. **Same target, multiple valid approaches** - Cetuximab (IgG1 + ADCC) and panitumumab (IgG2, no ADCC) both work

4. **Biomarker requirements persist** - Regardless of antibody format, tumor genetics determine response

## Head-to-head with cetuximab

The ASPECCT trial directly compared the two anti-EGFR antibodies:

| Outcome | Panitumumab | Cetuximab |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Overall survival | 10.4 months | 10.0 months |
| Conclusion | Non-inferior | - |

The drugs showed equivalent efficacy, with panitumumab offering advantages in convenience (dosing) and tolerability (fewer infusion reactions).
