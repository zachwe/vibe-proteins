# Adalimumab (Humira)

**Type:** Fully human [monoclonal antibody](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/monoclonal-antibody) (IgG1)  
**Target:** [TNF-alpha](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7124)  
**PDB:** [3WD5](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/3WD5)  
**Developer:** [Cambridge Antibody Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Antibody_Technology) & [BASF/Knoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbott_Laboratories)  
**FDA Approved:** 2002  

## The $200 Billion Drug

Adalimumab became the best-selling drug in pharmaceutical history, generating over [$200 billion in total sales](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/humira-abbvie-best-selling-drug-all-time) before patent expiration. At its peak, [AbbVie](https://www.abbvie.com/) earned $20+ billion annually from this single molecule.

But its origin story involves a small British startup, a revolutionary technology, and scientists who believed they could make antibodies without animals.

## The Origin Story

### The Cambridge Revolution (1989-1994)

In 1989, [Sir Gregory Winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Winter) at the [MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/) in Cambridge invented [phage display](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06753-y)—a way to evolve antibodies in test tubes instead of mice. The idea was radical: create billions of antibody variants, display them on viruses, and let natural selection find the best binders.

Winter and his colleagues [David Chiswell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-chiswell-9107314/) and [John McCafferty](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-mccafferty-8b85b61/) founded [Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Antibody_Technology) in 1990 to commercialize this approach.

### The BASF Partnership (1993-1996)

German chemical giant [BASF](https://www.basf.com/), through its pharma subsidiary Knoll, partnered with CAT to find antibodies against TNF-alpha. The project was led by scientists who had been following the emerging TNF hypothesis in autoimmune disease.

Using phage display, the CAT team screened massive libraries of human antibody sequences. In 1993, they identified a candidate called D2E7—later renamed adalimumab.

### Why "Fully Human" Mattered

Earlier TNF blockers like [infliximab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infliximab) used mouse antibody sequences, which triggered immune reactions in ~15% of patients. D2E7 was revolutionary: **entirely human sequences**, generated without ever immunizing an animal.

> "We proved you could make a fully human antibody that worked as a drug. That changed everything." — A CAT scientist, [quoted in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0696-845)

## How It Works

### What is TNF-alpha?

[Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7124) is a [cytokine](https://www.immunology.org/public-information/bitesized-immunology/receptors-and-molecules/cytokines)—a signaling molecule that triggers inflammation. It's produced by immune cells when they detect danger (infection, tissue damage).

In autoimmune diseases, TNF-α is overproduced, causing chronic inflammation that damages healthy tissue.

### The Binding Mechanism

[The crystal structure](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/3WD5) shows adalimumab acts like a molecular sponge:

- Binds directly to TNF-α's receptor-binding face
- Buries ~2,000 Å² of surface area (a large [protein-protein interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein%E2%80%93protein_interaction))
- Prevents TNF from engaging its receptors ([TNFR1](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P19438) and [TNFR2](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P20333))
- Works through [competitive inhibition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_inhibition)

## Clinical Impact

Adalimumab transformed treatment for millions of patients with:

- [Rheumatoid arthritis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353648)
- [Crohn's disease](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353304)
- [Psoriasis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/psoriasis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355840)
- [Ulcerative colitis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ulcerative-colitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353326)
- And [many more](https://www.drugs.com/humira.html)

The [biosimilar](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/biosimilars/biosimilar-basics) era began in 2023 when patents expired, making this life-changing therapy more accessible.

## The Nobel Prize

Gregory Winter shared the [2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2018/winter/facts/) for phage display. The Nobel committee specifically cited adalimumab as proof that the technology could create transformative medicines.

## Design Lessons

1. **Fully human = less immunogenic** — No foreign sequences means fewer immune reactions
2. **Technology platforms matter** — Phage display enabled antibodies impossible to find naturally
3. **Large interfaces = tight binding** — More contact area generally means higher affinity
4. **Blocking receptor sites works** — Competitive inhibition is a proven drug strategy
