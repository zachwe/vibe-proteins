# Certolizumab: The Fab-Only Approach

**Type:** PEGylated [Fab fragment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_antigen-binding)  
**Target:** [TNF-alpha](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7124)  
**PDB:** [5WUX](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5WUX)  
**Developer:** [UCB](https://www.ucb.com/) (Brussels, Belgium)  
**FDA Approved:** 2008

## A Different Kind of Antibody Drug

Certolizumab pegol ([Cimzia](https://www.cimzia.com/)) breaks the mold. While other TNF blockers are full antibodies, certolizumab is just a [Fab fragment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_antigen-binding)—the antigen-binding tip—attached to a polymer called [PEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_glycol).

This unusual design has important medical consequences, especially for pregnant patients.

## The Origin Story

### UCB's PEGylation Platform

[UCB](https://www.ucb.com/), a Belgian pharmaceutical company, developed expertise in [PEGylation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation)—attaching polyethylene glycol chains to proteins. PEG had been used to extend the half-life of small proteins that would otherwise be cleared quickly by the kidneys.

Their scientists asked: **what if we applied this to antibody fragments?**

### Why Remove the Fc?

Full [IgG antibodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G) have an [Fc region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_crystallizable_region) that:

- Crosses the [placenta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta) (via [FcRn receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_Fc_receptor))
- Triggers [effector functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody-dependent_cellular_cytotoxicity) (ADCC, CDC)
- Has a long half-life (~21 days)

For some uses, these properties are undesirable.

### The Pregnancy Advantage

TNF blockers are often used in women of childbearing age (rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease). Full antibodies like infliximab and adalimumab cross the placenta and accumulate in the fetus.

By removing the Fc, certolizumab **doesn't cross the placenta**. Studies have confirmed [minimal fetal exposure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5773405/), making it the preferred TNF blocker during pregnancy.

## The PEGylation Technology

Without an Fc region, a Fab fragment would have a half-life of only hours—too short for a chronic disease drug. UCB's solution:

1. Attach a 40 kDa [PEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_glycol) chain to the Fab
2. The PEG shields the protein from degradation
3. The larger size reduces kidney filtration
4. Result: ~14-day half-life (comparable to full antibodies)

## Binding Mechanism

[The crystal structure](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5WUX) reveals certolizumab binds a **unique epitope**:

| TNF Blocker | Primary Epitope |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Infliximab | E-F loop |
| Adalimumab | Receptor-binding face |
| Certolizumab | D-E loop + G-H loops |

Three different drugs, three different binding sites—all effectively neutralize TNF. This demonstrates the multiple ways you can inhibit a single target.

### Conformational Change

Uniquely, certolizumab binding induces a conformational change in TNF's D-E loop. This may contribute to its neutralizing potency.

## Clinical Uses

Certolizumab is approved for:

- [Rheumatoid arthritis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353648)
- [Crohn's disease](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353304)
- [Psoriatic arthritis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/psoriatic-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354076)
- [Ankylosing spondylitis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ankylosing-spondylitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354808)
- [Plaque psoriasis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/psoriasis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355840)

## Design Lessons

1. **You don't always need a full antibody** — Fragments can be effective drugs
2. **Removing features can be advantageous** — No Fc = no placental transfer
3. **PEGylation extends half-life** — Chemical modification compensates for small size
4. **Many epitopes can work** — Certolizumab's unique site is just as effective
5. **Consider the patient population** — Design for the people who'll use the drug
