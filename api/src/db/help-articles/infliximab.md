# Infliximab: The First TNF Blocker

**Type:** [Chimeric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimeric_antibody) [monoclonal antibody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibody) (IgG1κ)  
**Target:** [TNF-alpha](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7124)  
**PDB:** [4G3Y](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4G3Y)  
**Developer:** [Centocor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janssen_Biotech) (now Janssen/J&J)  
**FDA Approved:** 1998

## The First of Its Kind

Infliximab was the first [TNF-alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor) blocker approved for clinical use, launching what became a multi-billion dollar drug class. Its story involves a risky bet, a dying company, and a dramatic clinical trial.

## The Origin Story

### The Centocor Crisis (Early 1990s)

[Centocor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janssen_Biotech) was a Philadelphia-area biotech founded in 1979. By the early 1990s, they were in trouble. Their lead product, a sepsis antibody called Centoxin, had failed in late-stage trials. The company lost 95% of its stock value.

CEO [Hubert Schoemaker](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/08/business/hubert-schoemaker-founder-of-centocor-dies-at-55.html) needed a new direction.

### The TNF Hypothesis

Scientists at [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/) and elsewhere had been studying [TNF-alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor) in [autoimmune disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease). The hypothesis: blocking this inflammatory [cytokine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine) might calm the immune system in diseases like [rheumatoid arthritis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353648).

It was controversial. TNF was thought to be essential for fighting infections. Blocking it might be dangerous.

### The cA2 Antibody

Centocor scientists, led by [James Woody](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-woody-74553310/), created a chimeric antibody against TNF-alpha:

- **Mouse variable regions** — The part that binds TNF
- **Human constant regions** — The rest of the antibody

They called it cA2 (chimeric anti-TNF antibody #2). It would later be named infliximab, then branded as [Remicade](https://www.remicade.com/).

### The Dramatic Clinical Trial

In 1993, [Marc Feldmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Feldmann) and [Ravinder Maini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravinder_N._Maini) at London's [Kennedy Institute](https://www.kennedy.ox.ac.uk/) ran a small trial in rheumatoid arthritis patients. The results were dramatic:

> "Patients who had been crippled for years started moving again within days. It was like nothing we'd ever seen." — Marc Feldmann, [quoted in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00663-z)

## How It Works

### Chimeric Antibody Structure

"[Chimeric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimeric_antibody)" means the antibody is part mouse, part human:

```
Mouse variable regions (bind TNF) + Human constant regions (Fc, etc.)
```

This was necessary because [hybridoma technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridoma_technology) at the time produced mouse antibodies. Grafting onto human constant regions reduced (but didn't eliminate) [immunogenicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenicity).

### Binding Mechanism

[The crystal structure](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4G3Y) shows infliximab binds the [E-F loop](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3779706/) of TNF-alpha—different from adalimumab's epitope:

| Feature | Infliximab | Adalimumab |
|---------|------------|------------|
| Epitope | E-F loop | Receptor-binding face |
| Buried area | ~1,400 Å² | ~2,000 Å² |
| Origin | Mouse hybridoma | Phage display |

Both work by preventing TNF from engaging its receptors ([TNFR1](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P19438)/[TNFR2](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P20333)).

## The Immunogenicity Problem

Infliximab's mouse sequences cause problems:

- **~10-15% of patients** develop [anti-drug antibodies (ADAs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-drug_antibody)
- ADAs can **reduce efficacy** over time
- Often co-administered with [methotrexate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methotrexate) to suppress immune response

This limitation drove development of fully human alternatives like [adalimumab](./adalimumab).

## Legacy

Despite its limitations, infliximab transformed medicine:

- **Proved TNF is a valid target** — Opened the door for a drug class
- **First biologic for Crohn's disease** — Changed gastroenterology
- **Showed antibodies could treat chronic disease** — Not just cancer/infection

## Design Lessons

1. **First-in-class isn't always best-in-class** — Later drugs improved on infliximab
2. **Immunogenicity matters** — Mouse sequences can trigger immune responses
3. **Multiple epitopes work** — Different sites on TNF can both be neutralized
4. **Clinical trials can surprise** — The dramatic response exceeded expectations
