# Pertuzumab (Perjeta)

**Type:** Humanized [monoclonal antibody](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/monoclonal-antibody) (IgG1)  
**Target:** HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2)  
**PDB:** [1S78](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1S78)  
**FDA Approved:** 2012  
**Developer:** [Genentech](https://www.gene.com/)  

## What is it?

Pertuzumab (brand name Perjeta) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets HER2, binding to a different epitope than [trastuzumab](/help/trastuzumab). While trastuzumab binds domain IV of HER2, pertuzumab binds **domain II**—the dimerization domain. This complementary binding makes them a powerful combination therapy.

## The strategic design

Pertuzumab was designed with a specific goal: block HER2 dimerization. Unlike trastuzumab, which primarily affects HER2-HER2 homodimers, pertuzumab directly prevents HER2 from pairing with other HER family receptors (HER1, HER3, HER4).

This matters because HER2-HER3 heterodimers are among the most potent signaling complexes in cancer. By blocking this partnership, pertuzumab shuts down a key escape route that cancer cells use to survive.

## Binding mechanism

[The crystal structure](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1S78) reveals pertuzumab's elegant mechanism:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Binding site | Domain II (dimerization arm) |
| Key contacts | Loops 265-277, 295-310 |
| Interface area | ~1,200 Å² |
| Mechanism | Sterically blocks HER2 dimerization |

The binding site is in the "dimerization arm"—a protruding region of HER2 that normally reaches out to contact partner receptors. Pertuzumab essentially puts a cap on this arm, preventing it from making the handshake.

## The power of combination

The [CLEOPATRA trial](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1113216) demonstrated the remarkable synergy between pertuzumab and trastuzumab:

| Treatment | Median Survival |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Chemotherapy + Trastuzumab | 40.8 months |
| Chemotherapy + Trastuzumab + Pertuzumab | 56.5 months |

This 16-month improvement in median survival—in metastatic cancer—was one of the largest ever seen in breast cancer trials.

## Why two antibodies work better

The pertuzumab + trastuzumab combination exemplifies rational drug design:

1. **Non-overlapping epitopes** - They bind completely different parts of HER2, so there's no competition
2. **Complementary mechanisms** - Trastuzumab blocks homodimerization; pertuzumab blocks heterodimerization
3. **Complete pathway blockade** - Together, they shut down HER2 signaling from multiple angles
4. **Additive ADCC** - Both antibodies recruit immune cells, potentially doubling the immune attack

## Clinical applications

Pertuzumab is approved in combination with trastuzumab for:

- **Metastatic HER2+ breast cancer** - First-line therapy with docetaxel
- **Early-stage HER2+ breast cancer** - Neoadjuvant (before surgery) and adjuvant (after surgery) treatment
- **HER2+ gastric cancer** - In combination with chemotherapy

## Design lessons for protein engineers

1. **Epitope mapping enables combination therapy** - Understanding exactly where antibodies bind lets you design non-competing pairs

2. **Target the right functional domain** - Pertuzumab's success came from targeting the dimerization interface specifically

3. **Structure predicts mechanism** - The crystal structure clearly shows why pertuzumab blocks dimerization

4. **Synergy requires complementarity** - The two antibodies aren't redundant—they address different biology
