# Ranibizumab (Lucentis)

**Type:** Humanized antibody Fab fragment  
**Target:** VEGF-A (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)  
**PDB:** [1CZ8](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1CZ8)  
**FDA Approved:** 2006  
**Developer:** [Genentech](https://www.gene.com/) / [Novartis](https://www.novartis.com/)  

## What is it?

Ranibizumab (brand name Lucentis) is a humanized antibody fragment designed specifically for injection into the eye. It blocks VEGF-A to treat "wet" age-related macular degeneration (AMD)—a leading cause of blindness in older adults.

## Why a Fab fragment?

Ranibizumab is unusual among therapeutic antibodies: it's just the antigen-binding fragment (Fab), not a full IgG. This was a deliberate design choice for ocular delivery:

| Property | Full IgG (bevacizumab) | Fab (ranibizumab) |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Size | ~150 kDa | ~48 kDa |
| Retinal penetration | Slower | Faster |
| Systemic half-life | ~3 weeks | ~2 hours |
| Systemic exposure | Higher | Minimal |

The smaller size allows better penetration into retinal tissue, while the short systemic half-life minimizes the risk of systemic VEGF blockade (which can cause cardiovascular problems).

## The bevacizumab connection

Ranibizumab shares its origins with [bevacizumab](/help/bevacizumab) (Avastin)—both derived from the same parent mouse antibody. However, they were optimized differently:

- **Bevacizumab**: Full IgG for IV cancer therapy
- **Ranibizumab**: Fab fragment affinity-matured for ocular use

Interestingly, ophthalmologists began using bevacizumab off-label for AMD (repackaged into small doses) because it was much cheaper. The [CATT trial](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1102673) showed similar efficacy, sparking debates about drug pricing and reformulation.

## Mechanism of action

In wet AMD, abnormal blood vessels grow under the retina (choroidal neovascularization). These leaky vessels cause:
- Fluid accumulation under the retina
- Distorted vision
- Scarring and permanent vision loss

VEGF-A drives this abnormal vessel growth. By blocking VEGF-A, ranibizumab:
1. Stops new vessel formation
2. Reduces vascular leakage
3. Can improve vision (not just slow decline)

## Clinical impact

Before anti-VEGF therapy, wet AMD patients faced inevitable vision loss. Ranibizumab changed this:

| Outcome | Before anti-VEGF | With ranibizumab |
|---------|------------------|------------------|
| Vision loss | Progressive | Often stabilized |
| Vision improvement | Rare | 30-40% of patients |
| Legal blindness | Common endpoint | Often prevented |

The [MARINA](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa054481) and [ANCHOR](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0801432) trials showed dramatic results: patients gaining vision instead of losing it.

## Intravitreal injection

Ranibizumab requires direct injection into the eye—a procedure that sounds alarming but is routine:

1. Eye is numbed with anesthetic drops
2. Antiseptic applied to prevent infection
3. Tiny needle injects ~0.05 mL into the vitreous
4. Takes seconds; minimal discomfort

Patients typically need injections every 4-8 weeks, sometimes for years. This treatment burden has driven development of longer-acting alternatives.

## Design lessons for protein engineers

1. **Format matters for delivery** - The Fab format enables ocular delivery that wouldn't work with full IgG

2. **Affinity maturation pays off** - Ranibizumab was affinity-matured beyond the parent antibody for better potency in the small injection volume

3. **Tissue-specific optimization** - Same target (VEGF), completely different format depending on the therapeutic context

4. **Competition drives innovation** - Off-label bevacizumab use pushed development of even better alternatives like aflibercept and brolucizumab
