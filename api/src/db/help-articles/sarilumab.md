# Sarilumab (Kevzara)

**Type:** Fully human [monoclonal antibody](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/monoclonal-antibody) (IgG1)  
**Target:** IL-6 Receptor (IL-6R)  
**PDB:** [8IOW](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8IOW)  
**FDA Approved:** 2017  
**Developer:** [Regeneron](https://www.regeneron.com/) / [Sanofi](https://www.sanofi.com/)  

## What is it?

Sarilumab (brand name Kevzara) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks the IL-6 receptor. Like [tocilizumab](/help/tocilizumab), it treats rheumatoid arthritis by dampening IL-6 signaling—but with some key differences in design and binding properties.

## Fully human vs. humanized

Sarilumab represents the next generation of IL-6R blockers:

| Property | Tocilizumab | Sarilumab |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Origin | Humanized (mouse CDRs) | Fully human (VelocImmune) |
| Affinity for IL-6R | ~1 nM | ~0.06 nM (higher) |
| Approved | 2010 | 2017 |

The "fully human" designation means sarilumab's variable regions come from human immunoglobulin genes, not mouse antibodies that were later humanized. Regeneron's [VelocImmune](https://www.regeneron.com/science/velocimmune-technology) platform produces these by using mice engineered with human antibody genes.

## Higher affinity binding

Sarilumab binds IL-6R with approximately **20-fold higher affinity** than tocilizumab. The [crystal structure](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8IOW) reveals how:

- More extensive contact surface with IL-6R
- Optimized CDR loop conformations
- Tighter complementarity at the binding interface

This higher affinity translates to more complete receptor blockade at equivalent doses.

## Clinical development

Sarilumab was developed through the Regeneron-Sanofi collaboration, following Regeneron's successful development of other antibodies using VelocImmune technology.

### MONARCH trial

The [MONARCH study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)30717-1/fulltext) directly compared sarilumab to adalimumab (the world's best-selling drug at the time) in RA patients:

- Sarilumab showed superior efficacy on multiple measures
- Better improvement in disease activity scores
- Similar safety profile

This head-to-head victory against a TNF inhibitor helped establish IL-6R blockade as a preferred mechanism for some patients.

### COVID-19 investigation

Like tocilizumab, sarilumab was investigated for COVID-19 cytokine storm. Results were mixed—some trials showed benefit, others didn't. The drug was not ultimately authorized for COVID-19, highlighting that even closely related antibodies can have different clinical outcomes.

## Design lessons for protein engineers

1. **Affinity isn't everything, but it matters** - Sarilumab's higher affinity provides more complete target coverage, though clinical outcomes depend on many factors

2. **Fully human platforms reduce immunogenicity risk** - VelocImmune and similar technologies can generate high-affinity human antibodies without humanization

3. **Head-to-head trials differentiate products** - MONARCH showed that even in a crowded market, superior efficacy can establish a new drug

4. **Same target, different outcomes** - Despite similar mechanisms, tocilizumab and sarilumab had different results in COVID-19 trials

## Comparing IL-6R blockers

| Property | Tocilizumab | Sarilumab |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Format | Humanized IgG1 | Fully human IgG1 |
| Affinity (Kd) | ~1 nM | ~0.06 nM |
| Dosing | IV or SC | SC only |
| COVID-19 EUA | Yes | No |
| Developer | Chugai/Roche | Regeneron/Sanofi |
