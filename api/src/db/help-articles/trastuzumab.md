# Trastuzumab (Herceptin)

**Type:** Humanized [monoclonal antibody](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/monoclonal-antibody) (IgG1)
**Target:** HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2)
**PDB:** [1N8Z](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1N8Z)
**FDA Approved:** 1998
**Developer:** [Genentech](https://www.gene.com/)

## What is it?

Trastuzumab (brand name Herceptin) transformed HER2-positive breast cancer from one of the deadliest subtypes to one with excellent outcomes. It was one of the first [targeted cancer therapies](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/targeted-therapies) and proved that molecular understanding of cancer could lead to effective treatments.

## The origin story

The Herceptin story begins with an oncogene. In 1984, researchers at MIT discovered a gene they called **neu** (later renamed HER2) that could transform normal cells into cancer cells. [Robert Weinberg's lab](https://wi.mit.edu/people/member/weinberg) showed that this gene was amplified in certain aggressive cancers.

[Dennis Slamon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Slamon), an oncologist at UCLA, made the crucial connection: he found that about **25% of breast cancers** had dramatically elevated HER2 levels, and these patients had the worst prognoses—average survival was just 3 years.

Slamon partnered with Genentech scientist [Axel Ullrich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axel_Ullrich) to develop an antibody against HER2. Genentech initially prioritized other projects, and Slamon famously had to fight for years to keep the program alive. The development was nearly cancelled multiple times.

The clinical trials were dramatic. In early studies, some patients with metastatic disease showed remarkable responses—tumors shrinking or disappearing. The [pivotal Phase III trial](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200103153441101) showed that adding Herceptin to chemotherapy increased survival by several months in metastatic disease.

The 1998 FDA approval was celebrated with champagne at Genentech. The story was later dramatized in the TV movie [Living Proof](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1229367/) (2008) starring Harry Connick Jr. as Slamon.

## Understanding HER2 biology

[HER2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2064) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that sits on the cell surface. Unlike other HER family members, it has **no known ligand**—instead, it acts as a co-receptor, partnering with other HER receptors to amplify growth signals.

When HER2 is overexpressed (often due to gene amplification), cells receive constant "grow and divide" signals, driving cancer. HER2-positive cancers tend to be:

- More aggressive
- Faster growing
- More likely to recur
- Associated with worse outcomes (before targeted therapy)

## Binding mechanism

[The crystal structure](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1N8Z) (solved by [Cho et al. in 2003](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01392)) reveals how trastuzumab recognizes HER2:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Binding site | Domain IV (membrane-proximal region) |
| Key contacts | Loops 557-561, 593-603, 610-620 |
| Interface area | ~1,600 Å² |
| Mechanism | Prevents receptor dimerization |

Unlike some therapeutic antibodies, trastuzumab doesn't directly block ligand binding (HER2 has no ligand anyway). Instead, it works through multiple mechanisms:

1. **Blocks dimerization** - Prevents HER2 from partnering with other HER receptors
2. **Triggers receptor downregulation** - Causes HER2 to be internalized and degraded
3. **ADCC (Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity)** - The Fc region recruits immune cells to kill the cancer cell
4. **Inhibits signaling** - Reduces downstream PI3K/AKT pathway activation

## The pertuzumab combination

[Pertuzumab](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/pertuzumab) (Perjeta) is a second anti-HER2 antibody that binds a **different epitope**—domain II rather than domain IV. This is important because:

- Pertuzumab blocks HER2 dimerization more directly
- The two antibodies don't compete for binding
- Together, they achieve more complete HER2 blockade

The [CLEOPATRA trial](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1113216) showed that the trastuzumab + pertuzumab combination extended survival in metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer to nearly 5 years—a dramatic improvement over chemotherapy alone.

## From treatment to cure

Perhaps the most remarkable development came in early-stage disease. In adjuvant therapy (after surgery), trastuzumab reduced the risk of recurrence by about **50%**. Many patients who would have relapsed are now cured.

| Trial | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| HERA | 10-year overall survival ~80% with trastuzumab |
| APHINITY | Pertuzumab addition further reduces recurrence |
| BCIRG-006 | Cardiac safety profile established |

## Design lessons for protein engineers

1. **Different epitopes = synergy** - Trastuzumab and pertuzumab bind different HER2 domains and work better together than either alone

2. **Multiple mechanisms matter** - Beyond blocking signaling, the Fc-mediated immune effects (ADCC) are crucial for efficacy

3. **Humanization enables chronic dosing** - Patients receive trastuzumab for a year or more; the humanized format minimizes immunogenicity

4. **Structure-guided optimization** - The crystal structure enabled rational design of antibody-drug conjugates like [T-DM1](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/ado-trastuzumab-emtansine)
