It might be the most important tool in modern biology!\n\n### Why scientists love GFP\nScientists attach GFP to other proteins to track them inside living cells. Want to know where a protein goes? Make it glow! The 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded for GFP's discovery and development.\n\n### The beautiful barrel structure\nGFP has a unique shape - an 11-stranded [beta-barrel](gpt:beta%20barrel||What%20is%20a%20beta%20barrel%20protein%20structure?%20Explain%20simply.) with the glowing part (chromophore) protected inside. This structure is so stable that GFP works even in harsh conditions.\n\n### Rainbow of colors\nScientists have engineered GFP variants in almost every color:\n- Blue (BFP)\n- Cyan (CFP)\n- Yellow (YFP)\n- Red (from corals, like [mCherry](gpt:mCherry||What%20is%20mCherry%20and%20how%20is%20it%20related%20to%20GFP?))\n\n### Design challenge\nGFP is well-folded and stable, making it a nice beginner target. A GFP-binding protein could be useful for capturing or detecting GFP-tagged proteins in experiments!",
