# Test Sequences for Custom Submission

These sequences can be used to test the /submit page (custom sequence submission flow).

## Usage

1. Go to http://localhost:5173/submit
2. Select a challenge (e.g., IL-6)
3. Paste one of the sequences below
4. Click "Submit for Scoring"

The submission will run Boltz-2 folding followed by scoring (~1-2 min).

## Humanized Nanobody (124 residues)

Standard humanized VHH scaffold with typical CDR loops:

## Minimal Nanobody (114 residues)

## Notes

- Both sequences are valid amino acid sequences (20-500 residues)
- They use standard nanobody framework regions (FR1-FR4)
- These are generic test scaffolds, not optimized for any specific target
- Expect modest scores since these aren't designed for IL-6 specifically
